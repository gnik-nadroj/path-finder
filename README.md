# C++ Pathfinder

The C++ Pathfinder is a command-line tool that finds a path through a maze using various pathfinding algorithms. The maze is represented in a text file, where walls are denoted by "\*" and open routes by " ". The starting position is marked as "1" and the ending position is marked as "2". This project currently implements Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms and A\*. Others algorithms are planned to be added in the future.
