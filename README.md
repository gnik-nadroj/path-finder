# C++ Pathfinder

The C++ Pathfinder is a command-line tool that finds a path through a maze using various pathfinding algorithms. The maze is represented in a text file, where walls are denoted by "*" and open routes by " ". The starting position is marked as "1" and the ending position is marked as "2. This project currently implements Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms, A* and other algorithms in the future.
